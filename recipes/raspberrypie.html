    <h1>Raspberry Pie</h1>
    <p>This raspberry pie recipe is a wonderful way to use those raspberries growing in the yard.</p>
     <h3>Ingredients</h3>
     <ul>
        <li>
            1 (14.1 ounce) package double-crust pie pastry, thawed
        </li>
        <li>
            4 cups raspberries
        </li>
        <li>
            1 cup white sugar
        </li>
        <li>
            2 ½ tablespoons tapioca
        </li>
        <li>
            1 tablespoon lemon juice
        </li>
        <li>
            ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
        </li>
        <li>
            ⅛ teaspoon salt
        </li>
        <li>
            4 teaspoons butter
        </li>
        <li>
            1 tablespoon half-and-half cream
        </li>
     </ul>

     <h3>Steps</h3>
     
     <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line the bottom and sides of a 9-inch pie plate with one pie crust.
        </li>
        <li>
            Mix raspberries, sugar, tapioca, lemon juice, cinnamon, and salt together in a large bowl until raspberries are well coated; pour into pie crust and dot with butter.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cover filling with remaining pie crust; flute edges to seal. Brush cream on top, then cut several slits to allow steam to escape.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake pie in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce the heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) and bake until crust is golden and filling is bubbly, about 30 to 35 minutes more. Allow pie to cool completely before serving.
        </li>
     </ol>
